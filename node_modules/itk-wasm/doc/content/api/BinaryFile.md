title: BinaryFile
---

A `BinaryFile` represents a binary file. For performance reasons, use [`BinaryStream`](./BinaryStream.html), when possible, instead. `BinaryFile` is a JavaScript object with the following properties:

**data**: The `Uint8Arrray` with the binary data.
**path**: The `String` file path.
