title: Node.js Hello World!
---

This example, walks through how to compile a *hello world* executable written in C++ to JavaScript and execute it with the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) runtime!

Before getting started, make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) are installed. On Linux, make sure you can run [`docker` without `sudo`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/477551/how-can-i-use-docker-without-sudo). On Windows, make sure [Shared Drives are enabled in the Docker settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/troubleshoot/#volumes). On Windows, also install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/), and run shell commands in *Git Bash*.

First, let's create a new folder to house our project.

```
mkdir NodeHelloWorld
cd NodeHelloWorld
```

Initialize the Node *package.json* file:

```
npm init --yes
```

Add `itk-wasm` to your project's dependencies:

```
npm install --save itk-wasm
```

Let's write some code! Populate *hello.cxx* with our Hello World program:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Next, provide a [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build configuration at *CMakeLists.txt*:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(HelloWorld)

add_executable(hello hello.cxx)
```

We use the `add_executable` command to build executables with itk-wasm. The [Emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) toolchain along with itk-wasm build and execution configurations are contained in the itk-wasm [dockcross](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross) Docker image used by the itk-wasm command line interface (CLI).

Note that the same code can also be built and tested with native operating system build tools. This is useful for development and debugging.

Next, build the program with the itk-wasm CLI, `itk-wasm`. This is shipped with the `itk-wasm` package, and the CLI can be executed from the local *node_modules* folder with [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). The `itk-wasm` CLI will invoke the toolchain contained in the dockcross Docker image. Build the project from the source directory containing the top level *CMakeLists.txt* file.

```
npx itk-wasm build
```

The project is built in `./web-build` by default.

To execute the project, create an `index.js` file to [invoke the module](../api/node_pipelines.html):

```
const path = require('path')
const runPipelineNode = require('itk/runPipelineNode')

const pipelinePath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'web-build', 'hello')
runPipelineNode(pipelinePath)
```

And run it!

```
npx node ./index.js
```

Congratulations! You just executed a C++ program compiled to JavaScript. ðŸŽ‰
